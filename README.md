C Library

In computer science, a library is a collection of non-volatile resources used by computer programs, often for software development.

Library code is organized in such a way that it can be used by multiple programs that have no connection to each other,
while code that is part of a program is organized to be used only within that one program.

This is what I intend to do.
Hopefully.
